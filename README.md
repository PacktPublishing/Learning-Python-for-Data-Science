# Learning Python for Data Science [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning Python for Data Science [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-python-data-science-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785886928), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Python is an open-source community-supported, general-purpose programming language that, over the years, has also become one of the bastions of data science. Thanks to its flexibility and vast popularity that data analysis, visualization, and machine learning can be easily carried out with Python. This course will help you learn the tools necessary to perform data science.

In this course you will learn all the necessary libraries that make data analytics with Python a joy.You will get into hands-on data analysis and machine learning by coding in Python. You will also learn the Numpy library used for numerical and scientific computation. You will also employ useful libraries for visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn, to provide insights into data. Further you will learn various steps involved in building an end-to-end machine learning solution. The ease of use and efficiency of these tools will help you learn these topics very quickly. The video course is prepared with applications in mind. You will explore coding on real-life datasets, and implement your knowledge on projects.

By the end of this course, you'll have embarked on a journey from data cleaning and preparation to creating summary tables, from visualization to machine learning and prediction. This video course will prepare you to the world of data science. Welcome to our journey!

Note: Before using the data files either put them in the same folder with the script, or point to their location by specifying the path in pandas.read_csv()

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is an introductory-level data science course for aspiring data scientists with a basic understanding of coding in Python and little to no knowledge of data analytics. If you already know Python, or another programming language; if you want to apply your knowledge in computer programming to data analytics, and learn how to conduct data science; if you have used another language for data science such as R, and want to add Python to your skillset, then this course is for you. Knowledge of intro-level programming topics such as variables, if-else constructs, for and while loops, and functions are highly recommended but not required.	
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
•	Python 3.6
•	Anaconda
•	Jupyter Notebook
